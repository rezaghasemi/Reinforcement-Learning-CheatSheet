# Reinforcement-Learning-CheatSheet
Cheatsheet of Reinforcement Learning (Based on Sutton-Barto Book - 2nd Edition) - http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf

In square brackets there are indicated references to the equations or paragraphs in the book.

Initially Inspired by: https://github.com/FrancescoSaverioZuppichini/Reinforcement-Learning-Cheat-Sheet but quite completely rewritten.

A lot of phrases are extracted from Sutton-Barto Book and/or Coursera Specialization on Reinforcement Learning (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning).
